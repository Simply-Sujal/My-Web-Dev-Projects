      <p>
        A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable
        personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard. Laptops
        typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the
        inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside of the lower lid,
        although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as
        laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are folded shut for
        transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes
        from lap, as it was deemed practical to be placed on a person's lap when
        being used. Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at
        work, in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal
        multimedia, and for general home computer use.
